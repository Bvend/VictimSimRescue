This folder contains enviroments configuration files and vital signal datasets for different scenarios and purposes.

The name of the folder represents:  
- the size of the grid (if the dataset contains the enviroment and agents configuration files)  
- the number of victims

For instance, a folder named _data_20x20_400vic_ would contain a enviroment of size 20 x 20 with 400 victims.
A folder named _data_800vic_ would contain only the vital signals of the victims for regression/classification tasks.
